## Number Guessing Game
# Overview
In this project, I created a terminal-based number guessing game that allows users to test players guessing skills while keeping track of their game statistics. The game will be implemented using Bash scripting, with PostgreSQL for data storage and Git for version control. This project is a great opportunity to practice your skills in scripting, database management, and collaborative development.

# Features
Interactive Gameplay: Users can guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

User Profiles: Players can create profiles to save their game statistics, including the number of attempts, win/loss record, and best scores.

Persistent Data Storage: All user data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, ensuring that progress is saved between sessions.

Version Control: Use Git to track changes and manage the project's development history.

# Technologies Used
Bash: For scripting the game logic and handling user interactions in the terminal.

PostgreSQL: To manage and store user data, game history, and statistics.

Git: For version control, allowing for easy collaboration and project management.
